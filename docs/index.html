<h1>Privacy Policy – AtomicSwap</h1>

<p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how AtomicSwap processes, stores, and protects your data.
    By using the AtomicSwap application, you agree to the practices described below.
</p>

<div class="section">
    <h2>1. Data We Do Not Collect</h2>
    <p>
        AtomicSwap is designed with privacy in mind. We do <strong>not</strong> collect or store:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Private keys</li>
        <li>Wallet seed phrases</li>
        <li>Personal identifying information (PII)</li>
        <li>Transaction history linked to your identity</li>

    <p>All sensitive data remains fully local on your device.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>2. Data We May Collect</h2>
    <p>
        To improve the application, we may collect anonymous, non-personal analytics data,
        such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Basic app usage metrics</li>
        <li>Crash reports</li>
        <li>Performance data</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        These statistics do not include any information that can identify you or your wallet.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>3. How Your Data Is Processed</h2>
    <p>
        All swap operations and cryptographic processes occur directly on your device.
        No private information is transmitted to external servers.
        AtomicSwap does not operate servers that can access, view, or manage your funds.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>4. Security</h2>
    <p>
        While we do everything to ensure that the application is secure, you are responsible for:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Protecting your device from malware</li>
        <li>Keeping your private keys confidential</li>
        <li>Verifying all transaction details before approval</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        The app may interact with blockchain networks, explorers, or decentralized systems to perform swaps.
        These services have their own privacy policies and are outside the control of AtomicSwap.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        AtomicSwap is not intended for users under 18. We do not knowingly collect data from minors.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Updates become effective immediately upon publication.
        Continued use of the app means you accept the updated policy.
    </p>
</div>
